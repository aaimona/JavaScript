// JAVASCRIPT is A ZERO-BASED LANGUAGE!!!

// Don't Repeat Yourself (D.R.Y) - one of the most important rule of programming!!!

// Always finish a line of code with a semicolon.
// Two slashes mark the beginning of a comment in JS.
// === equal to, !== not equal to

// if statement syntax:
if(     ) {
  
} else {

}

// pop-up box commands: confirm() - user is asked to confirm by clicking OK; prompt() - user is asked to answer a question
// naming a variable is case-sensitive
//declaring variables:
var myVariable = 30;
// changing the value of existing variable:
myVariable = 37;

// printing stuff to the console - NOT BY PRINT COMMAND:
console.log(myVariable)

// declaring a function:
var sayHallo = function(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);      // every line of code in this block AND the entire function must end with a ;
};

// there is a widely accepted rule that if the name of the function is more than 1 word then all the words in the name
// except the first one should begin with capital letter, e.g. thisIsMyFunction()

// SCOPE
// variables defined outside of a function can be accessed anywhere and are called global variables
// variables defined inside a function can be accessed only inside this function and are called local variables
// the word "var" used to define a function or variable creates a new object in the current scope (local or global)
